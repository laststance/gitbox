# Product Overview

GitBox is a Progressive Web App (PWA) for managing GitHub repositories in a visual Kanban board format. It transforms static repository lists into an interactive workspace where developers can organize, track, and manage their GitHub projects.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Kanban Board Management** - Create multiple boards with customizable columns (StatusLists) to organize repositories by workflow stage, priority, or any custom categorization
2. **GitHub Repository Integration** - OAuth-authenticated access to user's GitHub repositories with real-time data sync
3. **Project Context Storage** - Attach notes, links, and encrypted credentials to repository cards for enhanced project documentation
4. **Drag-and-Drop Organization** - Intuitive @dnd-kit powered interface for visual repository management with WIP limits
5. **Offline-First PWA** - Full offline support with local storage persistence and service worker caching

## Target Use Cases

- **Multi-project developers** organizing repositories across different clients, technologies, or phases
- **Team leads** tracking repository status across sprints or milestones
- **Open source maintainers** categorizing contributions, active projects, and archived work
- **Freelancers** managing client projects with attached notes and credentials

## Value Proposition

Unlike GitHub's flat repository list or project boards (which are issue-focused), GitBox provides a **repository-centric Kanban view** with:

- Cross-repository organization independent of GitHub's structure
- Encrypted credential storage for project-specific secrets
- Persistent notes and links for project context
- Offline access and local-first architecture
